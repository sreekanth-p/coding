# coding
This repo is to add multiple coding question and archive multiple solutions 

I started my career as a web developer and now working as a full stack developer. 
I am planning to learn algorithms and data structure. Even though we never use them in day to day rotine, I think it's important to practise and sharpen coding skills.
